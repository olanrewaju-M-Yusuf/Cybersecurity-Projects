# Enterprise-Wide Information Security Policy Framework

## Project Title
**Developing an Enterprise-Wide Information Security Policy Framework Aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and Mapped to NIST SP 800-53 Controls**

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern enterprises require a cohesive information security policy (ISP) framework that not only defines organizational intent but also aligns with international standards. This project introduces an enterprise-wide ISP framework integrating:
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** for policy development and ISMS implementation
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** as a control cross-reference

The policy addresses governance, risk management, access control, business continuity, and privacy, forming a comprehensive approach to managing information risk.

---

## 2. Objectives and Scope

**Objectives:**
- Establish a standardized and auditable information security policy framework
- Ensure alignment with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 clauses and Annex A
- Map each policy domain to corresponding NIST 800-53 controls
- Enhance enterprise-wide compliance, accountability, and transparency

**Scope:**
- Entire organizational units (IT, HR, Legal, DevOps, Cloud Security)
- Applies to both on-premises and cloud environments
- Covers all information assets, user groups, and third-party engagements

---

## 3. Assurance Opinion

**Rating: Substantial**

The proposed framework demonstrates:
- Strong adherence to ISO control structures
- Maturity in governance and policy lifecycle management
- Intentional mapping between business operations and security domains

However, continuous improvement and integration of business unit feedback is essential for sustainable success.

## 4. Findings

| Policy Domain | Observation |
|---------------|-------------|
| Governance & ISMS | No formal mapping of ISO policies to NIST controls currently exists |
| Risk Management | Inconsistent documentation of risk assessments |
| Access Control | Lack of least privilege enforcement in some SaaS tools |
| Supplier Relationships | Third-party data handling policies missing for SaaS vendors |
| Business Continuity | Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) undefined for cloud-hosted apps |

---

## 5. Areas for Development

| Priority | Area |
|---------|------|
| High | Define RACI matrix for policy ownership and review cadence |
| High | Integrate policy exception management and logging |
| Medium | Automate version control using GitHub or SharePoint DLP workflows |
| Medium | Train business unit managers on ISO/NIST mappings |
| Low | Formalize internal branding and metadata tagging for each policy document |

---

## 6. Action Plan

**Step 1: Define Policy Architecture**  
Structure all policies under a 5-layer taxonomy:
1. Governance (e.g., ISMS, data classification)
2. Risk Management
3. Control Domains (access, asset, crypto)
4. Operational Requirements (BC/DR, remote work, mobile)
5. Legal & Regulatory (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS)

**Step 2: Alignment Table**  
Map each ISO clause and Annex A control to NIST 800-53 controls. For example:
- ISO A.9 (Access Control) ↔ NIST AC family (e.g., AC-2, AC-3, AC-6)
- ISO A.17 (Business Continuity) ↔ NIST CP family (e.g., CP-2, CP-4, CP-9)

**Step 3: Implementation Workflow**  
- Centralize policies in version-controlled repo
- Use DLP alerts for unauthorized edits
- Assign quarterly review cycles per policy owner

**Step 4: Training & Awareness**  
- Develop onboarding materials for new joiners
- Conduct semiannual tabletop policy validation drills

## 7. Tools & Platforms Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Microsoft Purview | Policy lifecycle & compliance tracking |
| GitHub Enterprise | Policy versioning and change control |
| Power BI | Risk and policy compliance dashboards |
| NIST OSCAL/JSON | Policy-control mapping formats |
| ISO27001 Toolkit | Clause-based policy templates |

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- ISO 27001:2022 provides structure, while NIST 800-53 provides control depth
- Mapping enhances audit-readiness and operational alignment
- Policy governance requires lifecycle tracking, training, and ownership models
- Centralized repositories and metadata tagging ensure traceability
- Semiannual reviews maintain ongoing compliance with evolving threats
