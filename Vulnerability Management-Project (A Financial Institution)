# Vulnerability-Management-Project-Financial-Institution

## Project Title
**Designing and Operationalizing a Risk-Based Vulnerability Management Program in a Mid-Tier Financial Institution**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A regional financial institution operating digital banking and investment platforms faced repeated audit findings related to outdated systems, patch delays, and inconsistent vulnerability remediation. The GRC team was tasked with designing and implementing a **risk-based vulnerability management program** aligned with FFIEC, NIST, and CIS benchmarks. This program needed to be measurable, auditable, and integrated into existing IT service management (ITSM) processes.

---

## 2. Objective
- Build a repeatable vulnerability management lifecycle
- Integrate threat intelligence and risk scoring into prioritization
- Define SLA-based remediation plans by asset criticality
- Automate scanning and ticketing through SIEM and ITSM tools
- Ensure alignment with regulatory expectations (FFIEC, GLBA)

| IT Operations Team       | Owns remediation and patching across endpoints, servers, and infrastructure   |
| Threat Intelligence Team | Provides CVE context, exploitability data, and vulnerability insights         |
| Internal Audit           | Verifies process compliance and tracks control effectiveness                  |

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Asset Inventory & Risk Classification
Built a centralized CMDB and classified assets by sensitivity and business function. High-priority assets included core banking apps, payment gateways, and trading platforms. Asset tags were integrated with the SIEM and vulnerability scanners.

### Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning & Baseline Assessment
Deployed Tenable.io for scheduled internal and external scans. Mapped results to CVSS scores and overlaid threat intel feeds to identify actively exploited vulnerabilities (CISA KEV list).

### Step 3: SLA-Based Remediation Framework
Developed a tiered SLA model: Critical (48 hrs), High (7 days), Medium (14 days), Low (30 days). Jira Service Management was used to assign patching tickets automatically by severity and system owner.

### Step 4: Risk-Based Prioritization & Reporting
Used EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) to adjust priorities dynamically. Dashboards were created in Power BI showing risk heatmaps, SLA breaches, and business unit comparisons.

### Step 5: Policy Enforcement & Continuous Monitoring
Finalized a Vulnerability Management Policy and Patch Management SOP. SIEM alerts were linked to unpatched critical systems. Internal Audit performed quarterly process validation.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Aligning vulnerability remediation to risk and exploitability improves efficiency
- Integration with threat intel strengthens context-aware prioritization
- Asset classification is foundational to SLA accuracy and visibility
- Automating scan-to-ticket lifecycle reduces human error and speeds MTTR
- Executive reporting improves accountability across technology teams

---

## 7. Outcomes
- Reduced average time to remediate critical vulnerabilities by 72%
- SLA compliance rate improved from 58% → 94% in 4 months
- All external-facing assets now scanned weekly with zero missed critical patches
- Risk-based dashboards adopted by CIO and audit committee
- Achieved full FFIEC compliance on vulnerability and patch governance
