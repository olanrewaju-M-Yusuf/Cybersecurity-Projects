# HIPAA Compliance Risk Assessment Project – Healthcare SaaS

## Project Title
**Conducting a HIPAA Compliance Risk Assessment for a Cloud-Based Healthcare SaaS Provider**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A cloud-based healthcare SaaS company handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) for U.S. clinics and insurance partners faced increasing customer audits and regulatory expectations. While the organization had basic technical safeguards in place, it lacked a formal HIPAA risk assessment, which posed a business continuity risk and a violation of the HIPAA Security Rule. The GRC Analyst was assigned to lead a comprehensive HIPAA risk assessment aligned with HHS and NIST guidance.

---

## 2. Objective
- Conduct an enterprise-wide HIPAA Security Rule risk assessment
- Identify vulnerabilities affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI
- Map findings to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
- Recommend mitigation strategies and document corrective actions
- Prepare for OCR audits and HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) compliance

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR §164.308–316)**: Federal regulation governing ePHI protection [(HHS, 2023)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html)
- **NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 1**: Guidance on HIPAA Security Rule implementation [(NIST, 2008)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-66/rev-1/final)
- **OCR Audit Protocol**: Office for Civil Rights audit criteria [(OCR, 2023)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/index.html)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Scoping and Asset Inventory
Defined the scope of assessment: cloud-based patient portals, APIs, EHR integration pipelines, and data storage. Created a HIPAA-specific asset inventory covering databases, admin interfaces, mobile access points, and vendor access.

### Step 2: Threat Identification and Risk Rating
Used NIST 800-66 to identify threats such as unauthorized access, improper data disposal, and misconfigured access control. Risk matrix scored each based on likelihood and potential impact to ePHI confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Step 3: Control Assessment and Gap Analysis
Mapped existing controls to HIPAA’s Administrative, Physical, and Technical safeguard categories. Identified gaps in user access review frequency, data backup testing, and employee security training. Aligned findings to OCR Audit Protocol.

### Step 4: Remediation Planning and Risk Register
Created a corrective action plan for each gap, assigned owners, and timelines. Added all risks to a centralized HIPAA risk register maintained in ServiceNow GRC. Implemented weekly review meetings with stakeholders.

### Step 5: Reporting and Compliance Readiness
Generated a HIPAA risk assessment report with executive summary, risk ratings, and mitigation roadmap. Submitted final results to the compliance team and prepared documentation required for BAA partner attestations.
