# Phishing-Awareness-and-Defense-Project-Entertainment-Sector

## Project Title
**Building a Company-Wide Phishing Awareness and Response Program for a Global Entertainment Brand**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A global entertainment company with a high-profile digital presence and celebrity engagement suffered a series of credential-harvesting phishing attacks targeting staff, marketing teams, and contractors. These attacks jeopardized production assets, unreleased content, and personal data of talent. The CISO directed the GRC Analyst to lead a phishing defense project focused on awareness, simulation, response, and measurable resilience improvements across all departments.

---

## 2. Objective
- Develop and implement a phishing awareness and response program
- Conduct phishing simulation campaigns across departments
- Establish policies, response workflows, and playbooks
- Measure user susceptibility and improve email reporting culture
- Align with NIST, SANS, and industry best practices

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Baseline Assessment
Conducted a baseline phishing simulation across 400+ users in marketing, production, HR, and IT. Results showed a 34% click rate and 8% credential submission rate. High-risk users were identified for targeted training.

### Step 2: Awareness Program Rollout
Launched mandatory phishing training using interactive e-learning modules. Branded internal campaigns (“Think Before You Click”) were distributed via Slack and digital signage across studios. Monthly security tips and real-world breach stories were shared.

### Step 3: Simulation Campaigns
Deployed quarterly phishing simulations using Cofense PhishMe with randomized lures (e.g., talent contracts, Netflix clone links, Spotify password reset). Results were mapped to departments and business units.

### Step 4: Incident Response Integration
Standardized phishing reporting via “Report Phish” button in Outlook. SOC playbooks were updated to triage emails, quarantine malicious content, and initiate forensics. Awareness was embedded into onboarding.

### Step 5: Metrics, Dashboards & Feedback Loops
Created dashboards in Power BI tracking: click rates, reporting rates, time-to-report, and campaign performance. Insights were shared with department heads and used to drive incentives and recognition.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Awareness programs need creative, culturally relevant content to be effective
- Phishing simulations uncover user behavior insights beyond training metrics
- Incident response integration boosts reporting culture and reduces dwell time
- Leadership support drives company-wide buy-in and accountability
- Metrics and gamification sustain long-term engagement

---

## 7. Outcomes
- Phishing click rate dropped from 34% to 7% in 6 months
- Reporting rate increased from 12% to 69%
- 100% adoption of Outlook Phish Reporter plugin
- Simulated breach detection time reduced by 78%
- Internal audit approved awareness controls for ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.7 alignment
